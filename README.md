# Redux-Todo:  My first redux project

## What is this?
A simple todo list to grasp familiarity with Redux.  No more, no less.

The inspiration came from the [Redux.js.org](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/ExampleTodoList.html) example with flourishes of my own for organization and styling.

## What is the base for this project?

I used the non-ejected version of the [create-react-app boilerplate](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) with the [redux package](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) and [react-redux package](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) installed.

## How do I use this?
1. Clone or fork this repo.
2. `cd` into your copy, type in `npm i` and hit enter.
3. Type in `npm start` once the repository has installed.
